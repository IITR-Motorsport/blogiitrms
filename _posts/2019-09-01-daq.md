Data Acquisition System's main function is to acquire various sensors data and other important information from various electric subsystems. Sensors like speed sensor, inertial measurement unit (MPU6050), temperature sensor, GPS module and potentiometers are integrated with DAQ to measure speed, position, temperature, angle etc... Display devices (LCD) and storage devices (SD card) are also integrated with DAQ to facilitate driver with some required information like speed, state of charge of battery etc… and store real time sensor data in SD card. 

The stored data is very important for checking proper functioning of various mechanical systems. DAQ also acquire information like status/error signal data, energy dissipated from battery, discharge/charging current etc… from other electric subsystems like HV-LV sensing, Shutdown system, Motor controller etc… through CAN communication protocol. Microcontroller is programmed according to communication type (like I2C, SPI, UART or CAN) of sensor to acquire data from it. So DAQ system is useful for debugging the errors in vehicle, testing functionality various systems and facilitating user with necessary information of various subsystems of the vehicle.
