I"´<p>Electric vehicles have the potential to make the world a better place. In IC engine vehicles and electric vehicles and a further two-wheelers and four-wheelers, where the complexities in controls are drastically different, the common technology thread between them is a humble electronic component, the <strong>Electronic Control Unit</strong>.
Several features, widely integrated in four wheelers may include engine immobiliser, motor control unit, powertrain control, brake control, ABS, anti-theft alarm door control, human-machine interface and what not! However, here the focus would be on the electric race car motor control design and corresponding shutdown circuit and system.</p>
