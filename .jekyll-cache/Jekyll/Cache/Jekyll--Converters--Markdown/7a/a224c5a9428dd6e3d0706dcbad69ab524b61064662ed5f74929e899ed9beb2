I"ó	<p>Until 2010 people here at IIT Roorkee only admired and wondered about the amazing F1 cars they saw in races. But some students not content with simple admiration decided to quench their thirst by finding the IIT Roorkee Motorsports team currently known as IITRMS.</p>

<p>The team represents IIT Roorkee in national &amp; International Formula Student competitions. After successfully participating in Australasia in 2011 where the team stood first in fuel efficiency and Formula Student Uk-2013 with the only hybrid vehicle amongst all participating teams, the team successfully geared up for its third competition. They participated with an Electric Racecar in FSAE Australasia- 2015 held in Melbourne. During that time besides preparing for the competition, the team also did eight projects for US-based startup Hybridtronics which was involved in the development of hybrid powertrains for heavy automobiles. The team also developed its own components like smart charger, Battery Management System(BMS) for further use in future projects.</p>

<p>Utilising the tremendous exposure that International Formula Student competitions offer remains the primary focus. The team is slowly growing its roots into research areas related to Electric Vehicles as well. So it will be very fascinating to find out more about this magnetic journey of the team from a group of gearheads to an embryonic R&amp;D think tank through the achievement wall itself. The aim of such competitions is not just to make an economic race car but the car has to pass through a series of intricate on-track safety tests too.</p>

<p>The team shifted its modus operandi from fuel race car to an electric vehicle in FSAE Australasia 2015 which was recognised as one of the biggest championships at the student level where teams participated all across the globe. With the depletion of fossil fuels and the government encouraging the use of vehicles running on alternative fuels, the team foresees a great demand for trained engineers in this field and hence, the young technocrats decided to participate in a greener way.</p>

<p>As of the latest, IITRMS is heading up with a new model this year too. The learning atmosphere at the team workshop fosters great technical skills among all interdisciplinary students. It really feels great to be a part of a team that has always proved the saying that ‚ÄúIf everyone moves forward in unison, then success takes care of itself.‚Äù</p>
